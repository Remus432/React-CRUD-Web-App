# React CRUD Web App

This web app allows the user to 

* Add Books
* Edit Data About Books
* View Books
* Delete Books

It was built using 

1. React
2. React Redux for state
3. React Boostrap for UI
4. UUID for generating an unique id


The purpose of this project was to learn how to use Redux at a larger scale but it turned out into a prototype of a very interesting web app. 
There is a high possibility I will further work on it and make improvements.
